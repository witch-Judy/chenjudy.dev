As co-founder of ILLUCIO, I take ideas from zero to one: designing the product, writing the code, and getting it in front of the right people. I share my journey through content creation across platforms, helping others navigate AI, open source, and product building.`,

  aboutPageBio: `I'm Chen Judy — builder, influencer, and co-founder of ILLUCIO. I live at the intersection of technology, product, and growth.

I don't just write code — I design products, build them end-to-end, and bring them to market. From AI-powered tools to community-driven content, I believe the best builders understand the full stack: tech, product, and people.

I also create content across platforms — sharing insights on AI, product building, and the startup journey — because building in public is one of the best ways to learn and grow.`,
